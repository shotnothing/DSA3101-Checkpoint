At a time when improved rail and road systems brought rubber and palm oil plantation owners over to Singapore from Malaya every weekend, it was known as the ‘Rendezvous of Planters’. Not a formal bar, but rather tables placed next to another facing Bras Basah Road, it was a vantage point from which male visitors surveyed the procession of ladies.

The earthy decor of the two-storey Long Bar is inspired by Malayan life in the 1920s. The deep, rich colours and lush greenery transport patrons to the edge of a tropical plantation. In keeping with the relaxed atmosphere, guests are invited to brush peanut shells off the table and bar counter to the floor. This is quite possibly the only place in Singapore where littering is encouraged.",46.75,,Tours,https://res.klook.com/image/upload/activities/mtpwjhef5t1ts7cbgddc.jpg,400,4.5,11,"['Easy refund', 'Instant confirmation', 'Book now for today']",false

A visit to their humble home cannot go without mentioning his simple ways and lifestyle. For example, there was no modern shower to speak of till 2003. They made do taking baths the traditional way with a plastic scoop and a large earthenware. His home and furniture was modest and often old and belonging to a different time.

Next on the routing is Tanjong Pagar, the constituency Mr. Lee choose as his home base from 1955 and where he continued to serve his residents for nearly 60 years.

The scenario presented outlines a high-stakes escape room challenge set against the backdrop of a deadly pandemic called Green Death-29, which has nearly devastated an entire island. As Elle, the daughter of a researcher striving to find a cure, you are tasked with retrieving missing journal pages to unravel the mysteries of St. John's Island and potentially find a solution to the deadly virus. Time is of the essence, with only 4 hours available.

The island of St. John's remains one of the few areas untouched by the virus, leading to suspicions about its history. The narrative hints at potential connections to the quarantine facilities built by the British in the 1900s, secret experiments carried out by the Japanese during World War II, possible involvements of Singapore's former president, Mr. Devan Nair, and even suggests a concealed, sinister plot waiting to be uncovered.

Elle must assemble a team of up to 5 individuals to explore the island, find the missing journal pages, uncover the truth behind the virus and the island's immunity, and ultimately, save humanity from the deadly pandemic. The escape room-style challenge offers a thrilling and urgent mission to decode the mysteries and prevent the virus from spreading further.

The storyline presents a thrilling adventure fraught with historical, scientific, and potentially clandestine elements, urging players to solve puzzles, decode secrets, and race against time to secure the missing journal and potentially discover the cure for the lethal Green Death-29.",158,,Tours,https://res.klook.com/image/upload/activities/mz6mq89ysfg2wbpfit9u.jpg,,,,['Instant confirmation'],false

Massage technique:
The therapist may use traditional massage techniques, such as long strokes, circular movements, and kneading. They may also use the stones as tools to apply deeper pressure to specific areas of your body.

Stone removal:
After the massage is complete, the therapist will remove the stones and ask you to turn over onto your back. They may use a towel to help protect your skin from the hot stones as they are removed.

469,Spiritual Empowerment Blessing Experience in Singapore,https://www.klook.com/en-US/activity/85307-spiritual-empowerment-blessing-experience-singapore/,"Dhammakamo (DK), a spiritual mentor of long-term meditators & a teacher to esoteric practitioners, has been instrumental in helping speed up their mental progress with his clarity of wisdom & compassion. Due to his strong foundation in moral ethics & integrity, DK was bestowed with much spiritual & esoteric wisdom, which he attained through his intensive practise & transmission from his gurus. Today, he is one of the rare few with the ability to perform spiritual empowerment & guide others regardless of their spiritual background.

The master will be in meditative mode throughout. Upon entering the relic hall, a consecrated balm & pure gold leaf will be applied to your palms & forehead. After that, you will sit in a circle & a holy cord will be passed around to represent the unbroken transmission & lineage of enlightened masters.

The session will begin with an introduction, contemplative instructions & a blessing in Pali. The chants in Pali include an invocation of the devas to grace the ceremony with their blessings & protection. Next, you will be given a lotus flower to hold while the master walks over to perform spiritual empowerment on you by placing the pagoda (stupa) over your crown. The pagoda contains sacred relics of the Buddha's enlightened disciples. After that, a mass energy infusion will be performed.

To manifest his consciousness in the quantum realm, the master cannot speak or tell you what kind of beneficial energy & balance he will perform on you at this point. The reason is that it can only be performed while dwelling deeply in shunyata-samadhi (concentration on the sphere of emptiness), in short, Oneness.

The master's physical body will be chanting in purely Sanskrit & Deva Language (Angelic Language of the Universe), while his astral body will split & emanate out to infuse every participant with energies according to their needs. As this will be done through the transcendence of ego & perceptions, the powers channelled will resonate fully with your energetic capacity.

After that, a sacred yantra will be inscribed on your third eye & palms. To complete the session, holy water will be sprinkled on you.",288,,Outdoor & sports activities,https://res.klook.com/image/upload/activities/ransywvgwbkzihvfck8p.jpg,,5,,"[""Klook's choice"", 'Easy refund', 'Instant confirmation']",false

Ergonomics of Your Computer Workstation
During this pandemic, we witness ever more cases of clients who have become victims of poor ergonomics – working off a laptop, working without a proper table, sitting for prolonged hours, etc. As mobile massage therapists, our team is privy to the remote-working setups of our Home Spa clients. Here, we share our findings and make recommendations based on sound ergonomics principles.
Ergonomics of Sleep
We spend a third of our lives sleeping. Ensuring we get the most of our sleep goes a long way towards a healthy mind, body and spirit. This talk dives deep into the topic of sleep postures for optimal musculoskeletal health, and is highly recommended for those with lower-back pain, neck/shoulder pain and arm pain.
DIY Massage for Neck & Shoulders
Neck and shoulder pain accounts for majority of the WMSDs in Singapore. It is clinically linked to other ailments such as chronic headache, limited upper-body mobility, arm weakness, chest tightness, breathing difficulties and eye strain. By learning how to relieve muscular tension in the neck and shoulders, you will be able to reduce physical stress, promote blood flow, gain mental clarity and work more productively.
DIY Massage for Lower Back
As many as 42% of office workers in Singapore report experiencing some degree of lower-back pain. Prolonged sitting and poor ergonomics contribute to this condition, sometimes even causing debilitating pain in the buttocks and legs. Learn how to use simple objects for self-massage so that you can alleviate lower-back pain, improve hip mobility and sit more comfortably.
DIY Massage for Upper Limbs
Spending a lot of time at the computer and repetitive use of the keyboard and mouse can lead to upper-limb disorders. As a result, simple activities such as typing, holding objects and turning doorknobs become excruciating. This module offers self-massage as an intervention in the early stages of upper-limb disorders to restore functionality of the wrists, hands and arms.
Correcting Your Sitting Posture
Prolonged sitting has been shown to raise the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity. It also aggravates muscular skeletal conditions, which are further linked to limited mobility, poor dexterity and even depression. This module offers integrated solutions to reverse the effects of prolonged sitting, awaken key muscle groups, get the blood pumping and recharge.
Managing Your Text Neck
With increase in deskbound work and use of mobile devices, ailments such as text neck and dowager’s hump have become more pervasive. This module covers deep stretching techniques, exercises and posture correction for spinal health and reduction of neck and shoulder strain.",500,,Outdoor & sports activities,https://res.klook.com/image/upload/activities/dghvuosi4bp9by1ummwg.jpg,,,,"['Private group', 'Instant confirmation']",false
